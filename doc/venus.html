  Venus is the second planet from the <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html">Sun</a> and the sixth largest.
       Venus' orbit is the most nearly circular of that of any planet, with
       an eccentricity of less than 1%.

  <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/v/venus.html">Venus</a> (Greek:
<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/aphrodite.html">Aphrodite</a>;
       Babylonian: Ishtar) is the goddess of love and beauty.
       The planet is so
       named probably because it is the <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/datamax.html#brightest">brightest</a>
       of the planets known to the ancients.
       (With a few exceptions, the surface features on Venus are named for female
       figures.)
</p><p>
  Venus has been known since prehistoric times.
       It is the brightest object in the sky except for the Sun and the Moon.
       Like <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/mercury.html">Mercury</a>, it was popularly thought
       to be two separate bodies: Eosphorus as the
       <b>morning star</b> and Hesperus as the <b>evening star</b>, but the Greek
       astronomers knew better.
</p><p>
  Since Venus is an <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html#infsup">inferior</a> planet, it
       shows <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/venus_phase.html">phases</a> when viewed with a telescope
       from the perspective of Earth.  Galileo's observation
       of this phenomenon was important evidence in favor of
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#copernicus">Copernicus</a>'s
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#heliocentric">heliocentric</a> theory of the solar system.
</p><p>
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/planetary/venus/venera9-10.jpg"><img src="venus_files/lander.jpg" alt="" align="left" border="0" height="78" hspace="4" width="200"></a>
  The first spacecraft to visit Venus was <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#marin2">
       Mariner 2</a> in 1962. It was subsequently visited by many others (more than
       20 in all so far),
       including <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#pioneervenus">Pioneer Venus</a> and the
       Soviet <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#venera7">Venera 7</a> the first spacecraft
       to land on another planet, and
        <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#venera9">Venera 9</a> which returned the first
        photographs of the surface (left).  Most recently, the orbiting US spacecraft
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#magellan">Magellan</a>
       produced detailed maps of Venus' surface using radar (above).
</p><p>
Venus' rotation is somewhat unusual in that it is both very slow (243 Earth days
       per Venus day, slightly longer than Venus' year) and
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#retrograde">retrograde</a>.  In addition,
       the periods of Venus' rotation and of its orbit are synchronized such that it
       always presents the same face toward Earth when the two planets are at their
       closest approach. Whether this is a resonance effect or merely a coincidence is
       not known.
</p><p style="margin: 0pt;">
  Venus is sometimes regarded as <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/earth.html">Earth's</a> sister planet.
       In some ways they are very similar:
   </p><ul style="margin: 0pt;">
	 <li>Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of
	      Earth's mass).
	 </li><li> Both have few craters indicating relatively
	      <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#young">young</a> surfaces.
	 </li><li>Their densities and chemical compositions are similar.
</li></ul>
       Because of these similarities, it was thought that below its dense clouds Venus
       might be very Earthlike and might even have life.
       But, unfortunately, more detailed study of Venus reveals that in many important
       ways it is radically different from Earth.
<p>
<a name="atm" href="http://www.solarviews.com/cap/venus/venusvis.htm"><img alt="" src="venus_files/venusvis.gif" align="right" border="0" height="150" hspace="4" width="122"></a>
  The pressure of Venus' atmosphere at the surface is 90
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#atm"> atmospheres</a> (about the same as the
       pressure at a depth of 1 km in Earth's oceans).  It is
       composed mostly of carbon dioxide.
       There are several layers of clouds many kilometers thick composed of
       sulfuric acid.  These clouds completely obscure our view of the surface.
       This dense atmosphere produces a run-away <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#greenhouse">
       greenhouse effect</a> that raises Venus' surface temperature by about 400 degrees
       to over 740 K (hot enough to melt lead).  Venus'
       surface is actually hotter than <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/mercury.html">Mercury's</a>
       despite being nearly twice as far from the Sun.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/gif/Venus.jpg"><img alt="" src="venus_files/VenusSmall.gif" align="left" border="0" height="117" hspace="4" width="135"></a>
  There are strong (350 kph) winds at the cloud tops but
        winds at the surface are very slow, no more than a few kilometers per hour.
</p><p>
  Venus probably once had large amounts of water like Earth but it
       all boiled away. Venus is now quite dry.
       Earth would have suffered the same fate had it
       been just a little closer to the Sun.
       We may learn a lot about Earth by learning why the basically similar Venus
       turned out so differently.
</p><p>
  Most of Venus' surface consists of gently rolling plains with little relief.
       There are also several broad depressions: <b>Atalanta Planitia</b>,
       <b>Guinevere Planitia</b>,
       <b>Lavinia Planitia</b>. There two large highland areas: <b>Ishtar Terra</b>
       in the northern hemisphere (about the size of Australia)
       and <b>Aphrodite Terra</b> along the equator (about the size of South America).
       The interior of Ishtar consists mainly of a high plateau, <b>Lakshmi Planum</b>,
       which is surrounded by the highest mountains on Venus including the enormous
       <b>Maxwell Montes</b>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/venus/sifmons.htm"><img alt="" src="venus_files/sifmons.gif" align="right" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="133"></a>
 Data from <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#magellan">Magellan</a>'s
       imaging radar shows that much of the surface of Venus is covered by lava flows.
       There are several large shield volcanoes (similar to Hawaii or
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html#oly">Olympus Mons</a>) such as <b>Sif Mons</b> (right).
       Recently announced findings 
       indicate that Venus is still volcanically active, but only in a few hot spots;
 for the most part it has been geologically rather
       quiet for the past few hundred million years.
</p><p>
  There are no small craters on Venus.
It seems that small meteoroids burn up in Venus'
       dense atmosphere before reaching the surface. Craters on Venus seem to come in
       bunches  indicating that large meteoroids that
       do reach the surface usually break up in the atmosphere.
</p><p>
  The oldest terrains on Venus seem
       to be about 800 million years old. Extensive volcanism at that time wiped out
       the earlier surface including any large craters from early in Venus' history.
</p><p>
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/venus/selu.htm"><img alt="" src="venus_files/pandora.gif" align="right" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="114"></a>
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/venus/pancakes.htm"><img alt="" src="venus_files/pancakes.gif" align="left" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="103"></a>
  Magellan's images show a wide variety of interesting and unique features
       including <b>pancake volcanoes</b> (left)
which seem to be eruptions of very thick lava
       and <b>coronae</b> (right)
which seem to be collapsed domes over large magma chambers.
</p><p>
  The interior of Venus is probably very similar to that of Earth: an iron core
       about 3000 km in radius, a molten rocky mantle comprising the majority
       of the planet.  Recent results from the Magellan gravity data indicate that
       Venus' crust is stronger and thicker than had previously been assumed.
       Like Earth, <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#convection">convection</a>
       in the mantle produces stress on the
       surface which is relieved in many relatively small regions instead of being
       concentrated at <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/earth.html#plate">plate</a> boundaries as
       is the case on Earth.
</p><p>
  Venus has no magnetic field, perhaps because of its slow rotation.
</p><p>
  Venus has no satellites, and thereby hangs a <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/hypo.html#neith">tale</a>.
</p><p>
  Venus is usually <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/see.html">visible</a> with the unaided eye.  Sometimes (inaccurately) referred to
      as the "morning star" or the "evening star", it is by far the brightest "star"
      in the sky.
      There are several <a href="http://nineplanets.org/astrosoftware.html#www">Web sites</a> that
show the current position of Venus (and the other planets) in the sky.
More detailed and customized charts can be created with a
<a href="http://nineplanets.org/astrosoftware.html">planetarium program</a>.

</p><p>
On June 8 2004, Venus will pass directly between the Earth and the Sun,
appearing as a large black dot travelling across the Sun's disk. This
event is known as a "transit of Venus" and is very rare: the last one
was in 1882, the next one is in 2012 but after than you'll have to wait
until 2117. While no longer of great scientific importance as it was in
the past, this event will be the impetus for a major journey for many
amateur astronomers. For all the details see
<a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/transit/venus0412.html">Fred Espenak's site</a>.

<h2>Open Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is some evidence of spreading and folding on Venus' surface and
       of recent volcanic flows.
       But there is no evidence of <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/earth.html#plate">plate tectonics</a>
       as seen on Earth.  Is this a result of the higher surface temperature?
  </li><li>The greenhouse effect is much stronger on Venus than Earth because of Venus'
       dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. But why did Venus evolve so differently
       from Earth?
