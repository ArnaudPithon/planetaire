<p>
In Roman mythology
<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/m/mercury.html">Mercury</a>
is the god of commerce, travel and thievery, the
       Roman counterpart of the Greek god
      <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/h/hermes.html">Hermes</a>,
       the messenger of the Gods.  The planet
       probably received this name because it moves so quickly across the sky.
</p><p>
Mercury has been known since at least the time of the Sumerians (3rd millennium
       BC).  It was given two names by the Greeks: Apollo for its apparition as a
       morning star and Hermes as an evening star.  Greek astronomers knew, however,
       that the two names referred to the same body.
       Heraclitus even believed that Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun, not the Earth.
</p><p>
Mercury has been visited by only one spacecraft,
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#marin10">Mariner 10</a>.
       It flew by three times in 1974 and 1975.  Only 45% of the surface
       was mapped (and, unfortunately, it is too close to the Sun to be safely imaged
       by <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#hst">HST</a>).
</p><p>
<a name="orbit">Mercury's orbit</a>
       is highly <b>eccentric</b>; at <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#perihelion">
       perihelion</a> it is only 46 million km from
       the Sun but at <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#aphelion">aphelion</a> it is 70 million.
       The perihelion of its orbit
       precesses around the Sun at a very slow rate.
       19th century astronomers made very careful observations of Mercury's orbital
       parameters but could not adequately explain them using
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#newton">Newtonian</a> mechanics. The tiny differences
       between the observed and predicted values were a minor but nagging
       problem for many decades.
       It was thought that another planet (sometimes called
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/hypo.html#vulcan">Vulcan</a>)
       might exist in an orbit near Mercury's to account for the discrepancy.
       But despite much effort, no such  planet was found.
       The real answer turned out to be much more dramatic:
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#einstein">Einstein</a>'s
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#relativity">General Theory of Relativity</a>!
       Its correct prediction of the motions of Mercury was an important
       factor in the early acceptance of the theory.
</p><p>
Until 1962 it was thought that Mercury's "day" was the same length as its "year"
       so as to keep that same face to the Sun much as the Moon
       does to the Earth. But this was shown to be false in 1965 by doppler
       radar observations.  It is now known that Mercury rotates three times in two of
       its years.
       Mercury is the only body in the solar system known to have an
       orbital/rotational <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#resonance">resonance</a>
       with a ratio other than 1:1 (though many have no resonances at all).
</p><p>
This fact and the high eccentricity of Mercury's orbit would produce
       very strange effects for an observer on Mercury's surface.
       At some longitudes the observer would see the Sun rise and then gradually
       increase in apparent size as it slowly moved toward the zenith. At that point
       the Sun would stop, briefly reverse course, and stop again before resuming its
       path toward the horizon and decreasing in apparent size.
       All the while the stars would be moving three times
       faster across the sky.  Observers at other points on Mercury's surface would
       see different but equally bizarre motions.
</p><p>
Temperature variations on Mercury are the most extreme in the solar system
       ranging from 90 K to 700 K.  The temperature on
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html">Venus</a> is slightly hotter but very stable.
</p><p>
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/mercury/mercury1.htm"><img alt="" src="mercury_files/mercury1.gif" align="right" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="133"></a>
Mercury is in many ways similar to the <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html">Moon</a>:
       its surface is heavily cratered and very
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#old">old</a>;
       it has no
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/earth.html#plate">plate tectonics</a>.
       On the other hand, Mercury is much denser than the Moon (5.43 gm/cm3 vs 3.34).
       Mercury is the second
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/datamax.html#densest">densest</a> major body in the
       solar system, after <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/earth.html">Earth</a>. Actually Earth's density is
       due in part to gravitational compression; if not for this, Mercury would be
       denser than Earth.
       This indicates that Mercury's dense iron core is
       relatively larger than Earth's, probably comprising
       the majority of the planet.  Mercury therefore has only a relatively thin
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#silicate">silicate</a> mantle and crust.
</p><p>
Mercury's interior is dominated by a large iron core whose radius is 1800 to 1900
       km.  The silicate outer shell (analogous to Earth's mantle and crust)
       is only 500 to 600 km thick.  At least some of the core is probably molten.
</p><p>
Mercury actually has a very thin atmosphere
consisting of atoms blasted off its surface by the
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html#solarwind">solar wind</a>.  Because Mercury is so hot, these atoms
quickly escape into space.  Thus in contrast to the Earth and Venus whose atmospheres
are stable, Mercury's atmosphere is constantly being replenished.
</p><p>
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/mercury/mercury2.htm"><img alt="" src="mercury_files/mercury2.gif" align="left" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="131"></a>
The surface of Mercury exhibits enormous escarpments, some up to hundreds of
       kilometers in length and as much as three kilometers high.
       Some cut thru the rings
       of craters and other features in such a way as to indicate that they were formed
       by compression.  It is estimated that the surface area of Mercury shrank by about
       0.1% (or a decrease of about 1 km in the planet's radius).
</p><p>
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/mercury/merccal.htm"><img alt="" src="mercury_files/merccal.gif" align="right" border="0" height="101" hspace="4" width="101"></a>
One of the largest features on Mercury's surface is the Caloris Basin (right);
it is about 1300 km in diameter.
       It is thought to be similar to the large
       basins (maria) on the <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html">Moon</a>. Like the lunar basins, it
       was probably caused by a very large
       impact early in the history of the solar system.
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/captions/mercury/mercter.htm"><img alt="" src="mercury_files/mercter.gif" align="left" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="108"></a>
       That impact was probably also responsible
       for the odd terrain on the exact opposite side of the planet (left).
</p><p>
In addition to the heavily cratered terrain, Mercury also has regions of
       relatively smooth plains.  Some may be the result of ancient volcanic activity
       but some may be the result of the deposition of ejecta from cratering impacts.
</p><p>
A
<a href="http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Jan97/MercuryUnveiled.html">reanalysis</a>
of the Mariner data provides some preliminary evidence
of recent volcanism on Mercury.  But more data will be needed for confirmation.
</p><p>
Amazingly, radar observations of Mercury's north pole (a region
       not mapped by Mariner 10) show evidence of water ice in the protected
       shadows of some craters.
</p><p>
Mercury has a small magnetic field whose strength is about 1% of Earth's.
</p><p>
Mercury has no known satellites.
</p><p>
Mercury is often <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/see.html">visible</a> with binoculars or even the unaided eye,
      but it is always very near the Sun and difficult to see in the twilight sky.
      There are several <a href="http://nineplanets.org/astrosoftware.html#www">Web sites</a> that
show the current position of Mercury (and the other planets) in the sky.
More detailed and customized charts can be created with a
<a href="http://nineplanets.org/astrosoftware.html">planetarium program</a>.

<h2>Open Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mercury's density (5.43 gm/cm3) is nearly as high as Earth's.  Yet in most
       other respects it more closely resembles the Moon.  Did it lose its light rocks
       in some early catastrophic impact?
  </li><li>No trace of iron has been seen in spectroscopic studies of Mercury's surface.
      Given its presumably large iron core this is very odd.  Is Mercury much more
      completely differentiated than the other terrestrial planets?
  </li><li>What processes produced Mercury's smooth plains?
  </li><li>Are there any surprises on the other half of the surface we've not seen?
       Low resolution radar images obtained from Earth show no surprises, but you
       never know.
  </li><li>A new discovery-class mission to Mercury has been approved.  <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/index.html">MESSENGER</a> will launch in 2004 and orbit Mercury starting in 2009.
  </li><li>ESA will also send a spacecraft to orbit Mercury called <a href="http://sci.esa.int/home/bepicolombo/">BepiColombo</a>.
