Our Sun is a normal main-sequence <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#obaf">G2</a> star,
       one of more than 100 <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#billion">billion</a> stars in our galaxy.
</p><pre>        <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/data1.html">diameter</a>:    1,390,000 <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#km">km</a>.

                     15,600,000 K (core)</pre>
<p>
The Sun is by far the <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/datamax.html#largest">largest</a> object
       in the solar system.
       It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System
       (<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> contains most of the rest).
</p><p>
It is often said that the Sun is an "ordinary" star. That's true in the
sense that there are many others similar to it. But there are many more
smaller stars than larger ones; the Sun is in the top 10% by mass. The
median size of stars in our galaxy is probably less than half the mass
of the Sun.
</p><p>
The Sun is personified in many mythologies:
the Greeks called it
<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/h/helios.html">Helios</a> and the Romans
called it <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/sol_2.html">Sol</a>.
</p><p>
The Sun is, at present, about 70%
<a href="http://cst.lanl.gov/CST/imagemap/periodic/1.html">hydrogen</a>
and 28% <a href="http://cst.lanl.gov/CST/imagemap/periodic/2.html">helium</a>
by mass everything else
       ("<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#metal">metals</a>")
       amounts to less than 2%. This changes slowly over time as the Sun converts
       hydrogen to helium in its core.

</p><p>
The outer layers of the Sun exhibit
       <i>differential rotation</i>: at the equator the surface
       rotates once every 25.4 days; near the poles it's as much as 36 days.  This
       odd behavior is due to the fact that the Sun is not a solid body like the
       Earth.  Similar effects are seen in the <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html#gas_p">gas
       planets</a>.  The differential rotation extends considerably down into
the interior of the Sun but the core of the Sun rotates as a solid body.

</p><p>
Conditions at the Sun's <b>core</b> (approximately the inner 25% of its radius) are extreme. The temperature is
       15.6 million Kelvin and the pressure is
       250 billion <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#atm">atmospheres</a>.
       At the center of the core the Sun's density is more than 150 times that of water.

</p><p>
The Sun's energy output
       (3.86e33 <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#ergpsec">ergs/second</a>
       or 386 billion billion megawatts)
       is produced by <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reactions.
       Each second about
       700,000,000 tons of hydrogen are converted to about 695,000,000 tons of helium
       and 5,000,000 tons (=3.86e33 ergs) of energy in the form of gamma rays.
       As it travels out toward
       the surface, the energy is continuously absorbed and re-emitted at lower
       and lower
       temperatures so that by the time it reaches the surface, it is primarily
       visible light. For the last 20% of the way to the surface the energy is
       carried more by <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#convection">convection</a> than by radiation.

<a href="http://www.solarviews.com/cap/sun/sunspot.htm"><img alt="" src="sol_files/sun06.gif" align="right" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="150"></a>
The surface of the Sun, called the <b>photosphere</b>,
       is at a temperature of about 5800 K.
       <a name="sunspots"><b>Sunspots</b></a>
       are "cool" regions, only 3800 K (they look dark only by comparison with the
       surrounding regions).
       Sunspots can be very large, as much as 50,000 km in diameter.
       Sunspots are caused by complicated
       and not very well understood interactions with the Sun's magnetic field.

</p><p>
A small region known as the <b>chromosphere</b> lies above the photosphere.

</p><p>
<a href="http://www.solarviews.com/cap/sun/eclips94.htm"><img alt="" src="sol_files/eclipse77b.gif" align="left" border="0" height="150" hspace="4" width="150"></a>
The highly rarefied region above the chromosphere, called the <b>corona</b>,
       extends millions of kilometers into space but is
       visible only during a total solar eclipse (left).
Temperatures in the corona are over 1,000,000 K.
</p><p>
It just happens that the Moon and the Sun appear the same size in the sky as viewed from the Earth.
And since the Moon orbits the Earth in approximately the same plane as the Earth's orbit around 
the Sun  sometimes the Moon comes directly between the Earth and the Sun.  This is called a solar
eclipse; if the alignment is slighly imperfect then the Moon covers only part of the Sun's disk and
the event is called a partial eclipse.  When it lines up perfectly the entire solar disk is blocked
and it is called a total eclipse of the Sun.  Partial eclipses are visible over a wide area of the
Earth but the region from which a total eclipse is visible, called the path of totality, is very
narrow, just a few kilometers (though it is usually thousands of kilometers long).  Eclipses of 
the Sun happen once or twice a year.  If you stay home, you're likely to see a partial eclipse
several times per decade.  But since the path of totality is so small it is very unlikely that it
will cross you home.
So people often travel half way around the world just to see a total solar eclipse.  
To stand in the
shadow of the Moon is an awesome experience.  For a few precious minutes it gets dark in the 
middle of  the day.  The stars come out.  The animals and birds think it's time to sleep.
And you can see the solar corona. It is well worth a major journey.
</p><p>
The Sun's magnetic field is very strong (by terrestrial standards) and
       very complicated.  Its <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a>
       (also known as the <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/medium.html#heliopause">heliosphere</a>)
       extends well beyond <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/pluto.html">Pluto</a>.

</p><p>
<img alt="" src="sol_files/xraySunICON.gif" align="right" border="0" height="100" hspace="4" width="100">
I<a name="solarwind">n addition to heat and light, the Sun also emits a
       low density stream of charged particles (mostly electrons and protons)
       known as the <b>solar wind</b></a>
       which propagates throughout the solar system at about 450 km/sec.
       The solar wind and the much higher energy particles ejected by solar flares
       can have dramatic effects on the Earth ranging from power line
       surges to radio interference to the beautiful
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/help.html#aurora">aurora borealis</a>.
</p><p>
Recent data from the spacecraft <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#ulysses">Ulysses</a> 
       show that during the minimum of the solar cycle the solar wind emanating
       from the polar regions flows at nearly double the rate,
       750 kilometers per second,
       that it does at lower latitudes.
       The composition of the solar wind also appears to differ in
       the polar regions.
During the solar maximum, however, the solar wind moves at an <a href="http://sci.esa.int/content/news/index.cfm?aid=1&amp;cid=1&amp;oid=24671">intermediate speed</a>.

</p><p>
Further study of the solar wind will be done by the recently launched
       <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/spacecraft.html#wind">Wind</a>,
       <a href="http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/">ACE</a> and
       <a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/">SOHO</a> spacecraft from the dynamically stable
       vantage point directly between the Earth
       and the Sun about 1.6 million km from Earth.

</p><p>
The solar wind has large effects on the tails of comets
       and even has measurable effects on the trajectories of spacecraft.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.solarviews.com/cap/sun/sun.htm"><img src="sol_files/Sol.jpg" alt="" align="left" border="0" height="65" hspace="4" width="100"></a>
Spectacular loops and prominences are often visible on the Sun's limb (left).

</p><p>
T<a name="solarconstant">he Sun's output is not entirely constant.</a>
       Nor is the amount of sunspot
       activity.  There was a period of very low sunspot activity in the latter
       half of the 17th century called <i>the Maunder Minimum</i>.  It
       coincides with an abnormally cold period in northern Europe sometimes
       known as the Little Ice Age.  Since the formation of the solar system the
       Sun's output has increased by about 40%.

</p><p>
The Sun is about 4.5 billion years old.  Since its birth it has used up
       about half of the hydrogen in its core.  It will continue to radiate
       "peacefully" for another 5 billion years or so (although its luminosity
       will approximately double in that time).  But eventually it will run
       out of hydrogen fuel.  It will then be forced into radical changes which,
       though commonplace by stellar standards, will result in the total
       destruction of the Earth (and probably the creation of a
       <a href="http://nineplanets.org/twn/types.html#planetary">planetary
       nebula</a>).
